# DSP
Here are the DSP Tasks/Projects I worked on in College:
1. [Image Components Mixer](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/DSP/tree/master/ImageComponentsMixer) : The GUI mixes 2 compatable components of 2 images (real of image 1 and imaginary of image 2, magnitude of image 1 and phase of image 2) to generate a new image. 2 output images can be simulataneously generated.
